# EvoRobotics Group Assignment

## Team Members
- **Minsol Kim**
- **Yu Zeyuan**

## Project Files and Directory Structure

- `EvoRob03.py`: Contains the main genetic algorithm.
- `plots/`: Directory containing all the generated plots.
  - `fitness_distribution.png`: Plot of the fitness progression over generations.

## Tasks Completed

- **Algorithm Implementation**: Developed the Python script to perform genetic string evolution using a genetic algorithm.
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Implemented fitness evaluation using the `SequenceMatcher` from Python's `difflib` module.
- **Plot Generation**: Generated plots showing the distribution of generations needed to achieve the target string.
- **Results Documentation**: Captured and documented the output of typical runs, showing each generation's number and its respective string.
- **Mathematical Estimation**: Provided a mathematical estimation of the expected number of generations required to match the target string.
- **Empirical Simulation**: Conducted multiple simulations to empirically determine the average number of generations needed, comparing it to the mathematical estimation.
